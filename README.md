In the HTML, I created a list container to contain all of the todos the user creates. Within the Javascript, I dynamically create the task that the user enters by creating the list item and the remove button and add it to the list container.

## Optimizations

If/when I improve this project, I would start by letting the user unstrike the task when the check mark button is clicked on again. Also make it a little more responsive.
Update: I have successfully revamped this project!

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to dynamically add elements to the DOM. I also got more practice with local storage. Separations of concerns.
