In the HTML, I created a task container to contain all of the todos the user creates. Within the Javascript, I dynamically create the task that the user enters by creating the container that holds the task and create the text, check button, and the trash button inside the container.

## Optimizations

If/when I improve this project, I would start by letting the user unstrike the task when the check mark button is clicked on again. Also make it a little more responsive.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to dynamically add elements to the DOM.
